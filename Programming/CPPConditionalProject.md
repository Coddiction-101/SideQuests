# C++ Conditional Statements Practice Checklist

This file is our step-by-step practice map for learning conditional statements in C++.

Goal: har problem se ek useful real-world decision banana, so `if`, `else if`, `else`, logical operators, nested conditions, ternary, and `switch-case` naturally strong ho jaye.

---

## How We Will Use This

- [ ] Ek time pe sirf one problem solve karenge
- [ ] Pehle logic samjhenge in Hinglish
- [ ] Then code line by line likhenge
- [ ] Test cases run karenge
- [ ] Bugs fix karenge
- [ ] Jab concept clear ho jaye, checkbox tick karenge

---

## Level 1: Basic If / Else

Focus: simple true/false decisions.
    
- [ ] Age voting checker
- [x] Age voting checker (Done)
  - Concept: `if`, `else`
  - Logic: age `>= 18` means eligible, otherwise not eligible

- [x] Positive / negative / zero checker (Done)
  - Concept: `if`, `else if`, `else`
  - Logic: number positive hai, negative hai, ya zero hai

- [x] Even / odd checker (Done)
  - Concept: modulo `%`
  - Logic: number `% 2 == 0` means even

---

## Level 2: Else-If Ladder

Focus: multiple ranges and ordered checking.

- [x] Marks grading system (Done)
  - Concept: range checking, `else if`
  - Logic:
    - `90-100`: Excellent
    - `75-89`: Good
    - `50-74`: Average
    - `0-49`: Fail
    - otherwise: Invalid marks

- [x] Smart age category checker (Done)
  - Concept: ordered conditions
  - Logic:
    - child
    - teenager
    - adult
    - senior citizen

- [x] Temperature mood checker (Done)
  - Concept: range-based decisions
  - Logic: cold, pleasant, hot, extreme heat

---

## Level 3: Logical Operators

Focus: combine multiple conditions using `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

  - Concept: `&&`
  - Logic: username and password dono correct hone chahiye

- [x] Discount calculator (Done)
  - Concept: `&&`, `else if`
  - Logic:
    - high amount + member = best discount
    - high amount + non-member = smaller discount
    - low amount + member = small discount

- [x] Scholarship eligibility checker (Done)
  - Concept: multiple condition validation
  - Logic: marks, income, and attendance ke basis pe eligibility

---

## Level 4: Nested Conditions

Focus: ek decision ke andar doosra decision.

- [ ] ATM withdrawal system
  - Concept: nested `if`
  - Logic:
    - PIN wrong: deny
    - amount invalid: deny
    - amount greater than balance: insufficient balance
    - otherwise: withdrawal successful

- [ ] Movie ticket pricing
  - Concept: nested condition + calculation
  - Logic:
    - child discount
    - senior discount
    - weekend extra charge

- [ ] Weather outfit suggestion
  - Concept: nested condition
  - Logic:
    - cold + raining: jacket and umbrella
    - hot + no rain: light clothes
    - rainy: umbrella

---

## Level 5: Ternary Operator

Focus: short one-line decisions.

- [ ] Bigger number finder
  - Concept: `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`
  - Logic: two numbers me bigger print karna

- [ ] Pass / fail quick result
  - Concept: ternary
  - Logic: marks `>= 50` means pass, otherwise fail

- [ ] Even / odd quick check
  - Concept: ternary + modulo
  - Logic: one-line even/odd result

---

## Level 6: Switch Case

Focus: menu-based programs.

- [ ] Mini calculator
  - Concept: `switch-case`
  - Logic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
  - Extra: division by zero handle karna

- [ ] Food ordering menu
  - Concept: menu choice handling
  - Logic: user number choose kare, program item and price print kare

- [ ] Encryption method selector
  - Concept: switch menu
  - Logic:
    - `1`: Caesar cipher
    - `2`: XOR encryption
    - `3`: no encryption
    - otherwise: invalid choice

---

## Level 7: Mixed Logic Mini Projects

Focus: multiple conditional concepts together.

- [ ] Smart traffic signal advisor
  - Concept: string comparison + nested conditions
  - Logic: red/yellow/green plus emergency vehicle handling

- [ ] Student dashboard decision system
  - Concept: grading + attendance + fee status
  - Logic: student status summary generate karna

- [ ] Password strength checker
  - Concept: boolean variables + logical operators
  - Logic:
    - length enough hai ya nahi
    - number included hai ya nahi
    - special character included hai ya nahi
    - final result: weak, medium, strong

# Future Capstone: Password Manager & Vault

Ye hamara future project target hai. Abhi directly build nahi karenge, but conditional statements ke through iske small parts prepare karenge.

## Project Idea

A console-based password vault that can store, protect, search, generate, and retrieve passwords.

## Future Features

- [ ] Store passwords by website/app name
- [ ] Master password protection
- [ ] Strong password generator
- [ ] Search password by website/app
- [ ] Basic encryption/decryption
- [ ] Persistent file storage
- [ ] README documentation

## Concepts Needed

- [ ] Conditional statements
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Arrays or vectors
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] File handling
- [ ] OOP classes
- [ ] Random number generation
- [ ] Basic encryption
- [ ] Basic hashing idea

## Conditional Statement Prep For Password Manager

- [ ] Master password login checker
- [ ] Login attempt result checker
- [ ] Password strength checker
- [ ] Vault menu choice validator
- [ ] Password generator rule validator
- [ ] Encryption method selector

## Loop Prep For Password Manager

- [ ] Login with 3 attempts
- [ ] Menu repeats until user exits
- [ ] Generate multiple password options
- [ ] Search until matching entry is found

## Function Prep For Password Manager
